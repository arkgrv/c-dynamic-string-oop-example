# Dynamic String Library written in C
This project aims to demonstrate the possibility of using object oriented style in the simple, pure C Programming Language, by using constructs such as ***sturcts*** and ***function pointers***.<br><br>
This simple library can show you how it could be possible to use the ***C Programming Language*** in the object oriented style.

## 1. How to use it
Simply ***clone*** this git repository using the following command ```git clone https://github.com/simonerolando98/CDynamicStringOOP.git```.<br><br>
This will allow you to generate a project using CMake and create project files for most of the IDEs out there. Users of ***JetBrains CLion*** do not need to create project files using CMake Generators due to the direct CMake support built into CLion.
<br><br>
Visual Studio users ***can still compile this code as C*** since the proper flag has been correctly set in the compilation flags section dedicated to MSVC.

## 2. Features
This simple implementation aims to provide an experience similar to the one delivered by C++'s ***std::string*** object. This is ***obviously NOT*** part of a standard library, so the quality of the code is not on par with C++'s implementation.
