     This phase represents the equivalent of a "construction" of a string
     object in any object oriented programming language.
     Java uses the keyword new, while C++ uses implicit constructor calling
     in order to simplify the syntax.
     
     C does not have the luxury of constructors, so you have to make a
     "factory function" which is going to have to allocate the necessary memory and THEN
     apply operations to the function pointers representing the string object methods.
     
     This may seem counter-intuitive at first, but this kind of explicit declaration may
     in fact help to understand how modern object-oriented programming languages work.
